# Citibike API in Play! Scala

Citibike, operated by NYC Bike Share, is a program to help people explore the city.  This repo helps developers explore the Citibike API through Play!'s WS library.

There are also some example controllers that access the api operations directly and handle the returned Futures appropriately.
